# Web Development Courses

Hi!
This Repository is included my practice source code of these courses on Udemy:

https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/
(I done the half of it because i need just the basics)

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

 
And I'll upload my notes in Hungarian too. I have a Web Development Portfolio, and some of these projects are included because It can show you what I can do as a Web Developer.
This is not my full knowledge of programming and app development. I  have a deeper understanding of databases(Oracle) and Java development too.
